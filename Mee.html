    <p>Hi! My name is Bernice, a first year Computer Engineering student at KNUST. I chose to read this program because I love Computers, and always intrigued by everything about them.</p>
    <p>I love to read, make crafts and watch movies. I also like to code. 
        My favorite color is <span class="color">GREEN</span>, and my favorite scripture is Romans 8:38-39
        Yeah, always remember that God loves you! XoXoðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜™</p>
